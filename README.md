# miR-TS Manuscript

This repository contains processed data and analysis code to reproduce
all results and figures in the manuscript: "Circulating extracellular microRNAs as tissue-specific biomarkers of human health and disease" (in revision)

## Contents
- Processed miRNA expression data
- Computed miR-TS scores
- Analysis code for all figures
- Analysis code for miR-TS construction
- Analysis code for miR-TS application in 10 datasets
- Analysis code for data simulation and benchmarking

## Data sources
Raw sequencing data are being uploaded and the accession numbers will show up here; processed data are provided in the `data/` folder.

## Usage
1. Install the miRTS R package
2. Run scripts in `code/04_figure_generation`
3. Run scripts in other subfolders under `code/` to explore benchmarking analysis and other miRTS functionality

## Software environment
R version and package versions are provided in `environment/sessionInfo.txt`.
