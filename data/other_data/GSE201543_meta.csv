The exclusion criteria of participants were as follows: (1) any comorbidity that could significantly affect bone metabolism, e.g., thyroid disease, diabetes, cancer, kidney disease, or ankylosing spondylitis; (2) previous treatment with anti-osteoporosis drugs or hormones, e.g., estrogen or glucocorticoids; and (3) a history of tobacco smoking or alcohol dependence within the last year.",total RNA,RNA was extracted by mirVanaTM RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystem p/n: AM1556) following the manufacturer’s instructions.,Cy3,"Cyanine-3 (Cy3) labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.2 ?g RNA using the One-Color Low RNA Input Linear Amplification PLUS Kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, followed by RNAeasy column purification (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer.",9606,"0.6 ?g of Cy3-labelled cRNA (specific activity ? 10.0 pmol Cy3/?g cRNA) was fragmented at 60? for 30 minutes in a reaction volume of 22.5 ?l containing 1 × Agilent fragmentation buffer and 2 × Agilent blocking agent following the manufacturers’ instructions. On completion of the fragmentation reaction, 22.5 ?l of 2 × Agilent hybridization buffer was added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to Agilent Human miRNA Mircoarray (8 × 60K) for 17 hours at 65? in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, microarrays were washed 1 minute at room temperature with GE Wash Buffer 1 (Agilent) and 1 minute with 37? GE Wash buffer 2 (Agilent), then dried immediately by brief centrifugation.","Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent Microarray Scanner (G2565BA) using one color scan setting for 4 × 180K array slides (Scan Area 61 × 21.6 mm, Scan resolution 3 ?m, Dye channel is set to Green and Green PMT is set to 100?)",Circulting miRNA profiles of participants whose bone mineral density T-score > –2.5 (dual energy X-ray absorptiometry),The scanned images were analyzed with Feature Extraction Software 11.0.1.1 (Agilent) using default parameters to obtain background subtracted and spatially detrended Processed Signal intensities as the raw data. Raw data were normalized in quantile algorithm with Genespring 13.0 (Agilent). Probe that at least 1 out of 2 samples flagged as “Detected” were maintained.,GPL20712,"Shengli,,Zhao",zhaoshli3@mail2.sysu.edu.cn,Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Orthopaedics and Traumatology,Department of Spine Surgery,The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University,"No.58, Zhong Shan Er Lu.",Guangzhou,Guangdong,510080,China,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM6067nnn/GSM6067339/suppl/GSM6067339_SAMPLE_30.txt.gz,2570,
